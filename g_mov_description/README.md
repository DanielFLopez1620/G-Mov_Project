# g_mov_description

For now, there is no a proper description ROS 2 package, but rather a collection of files if you are interesting in replicate and modify the project. The software used was [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org/) and it was selected due as it is a Open Source CAD tool and the option to install it in Debian Systems.

You can also find the .stl files in case you do not want to use FreeCad, and even you can print the [base_gmov_body](/g_mov_description/mesh_files/base_gmov-Body.stl) to integrate it to your [Turtlebot3 Burger](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/).
